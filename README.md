# clojure-examples

A Clojure library designed to provide you with examples of Clojure code right in the repl. Because everything not in the REPL is too far away.

Goal is to complement `(clojure.repl/docs ___)` and `(clojure.repl/source ___)`.

Website with examples is coming soon at: www.clojure-examples.org

Right now there are very few examples. The examples will be pulled from these resources:

- You.

- clojure-docs examples (shameless)

- get-clojure (i.e. #clojure clojurebot chat logs).

## TODO

- Web hello world
- Web CRUD
- lein plugin
- Github login for web interface
